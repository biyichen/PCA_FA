#### Descriptive Statistics
#### The table opposite simply shows the means, standard deviations and sample size for each variable. It appears that the average score for all the tests is very similar and all have a similar spread. Next is the observed correlation matrix.

#### The KMO value indicates that we have is pretty poor – just above miserable, however Bartlett’s test of sphericity with an associated p value of <0.001 indicates that we can proceed.

#### Next is a table of estimated communalities (i.e. estimates of that part of the variability in each variable that is shared with others, and which is not due to measurement error or latent variable influence on the observed variable). The initial values can be ignored.

#### Next comes a table showing the importance of each of the six principal components. Only the first two have eigenvalues over 1.00, and together these explain over 96% of the total variability in the data. This leads us to the conclusion that a two factor solution will probably be adequate. This is the table showing the eigenvalues and percentage of variance explained again. The middle part of the table shows the eigenvalues and percentage of variance explained for just the two factors of the initial solution that are regarded as important. The effect of rotation is to spread the importance more or less equally between the two rotated factors. You will note in the above table that the eigenvalues of the rotated factor are 2.895 and 2.881, compared to 4.164 and 1.612 in the initial solution.

#### These show the expected pattern, with high positive and high negative loadings on the first factor:

#### The next table shows the extent to which the original correlation matrix can be reproduced from two factors:The small residuals show that there is very little difference between the reproduced correlations and the correlations actually observed between the variables. The two factor solution provides a very accurate summary of the relationships in the data.
