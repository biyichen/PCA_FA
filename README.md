#### Descriptive Statistics
#### The table opposite simply shows the means, standard deviations and sample size for each variable. It appears that the average score for all the tests is very similar and all have a similar spread. Next is the observed correlation matrix.

#### The KMO value indicates that we have is pretty poor – just above miserable, however Bartlett’s test of sphericity with an associated p value of <0.001 indicates that we can proceed.

#### Next is a table of estimated communalities (i.e. estimates of that part of the variability in each variable that is shared with others, and which is not due to measurement error or latent variable influence on the observed variable). The initial values can be ignored.

#### Next comes a table showing the importance of each of the six principal components. Only the first two have eigenvalues over 1.00, and together these explain over 96% of the total variability in the data. This leads us to the conclusion that a two factor solution will probably be adequate.
